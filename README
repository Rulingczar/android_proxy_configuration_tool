MetroPCS Proxy Switcher

This "app" allows the phone to automatically switch proxy and u2nl binary on and off depending on Wi-fi state.
It is made and pre-configured to work with Android phones that have been flashed to MetroPCS.

It must be built with the system since its using android.uid.system sharedId in order to be able to write to secure settings.

Have been tested and built for HTC EVO, Droid Incredible, and Motorola Droid 1.
Made to work with CyanogenMod 6.0+



TODO:

- Needs a better icon.
- Use sqlite database instead of Secure.Settings (If thinking about deploying to Android Market).
- Check for u2nl binary, if not available install it, it's in the assets folder (If thinking about deploying to Android Market).
- Document, organize and maybe improve configuration screen.

These guys were the ones that figured out and helped develop the method we are all using here to allow Android devices to work properly on MetroPCS.

Enjoy.
