Proxy Configuration Tool

This Android app allows the phone to automatically switch proxy and u2nl binary on and off depending on Wi-fi state.
It is made and pre-configured to work with Android phones that have been flashed to MetroPCS (Cricket will be supported too, very soon).


TODO:

- Check for u2nl binary, if not available install it, it's in the assets folder.
- Support for cricket (auto-disable use of u2nl if Cricket is used, alert and tell the user it's not needed).
- Needs a better icon.
- Document, organize and maybe improve configuration screen.

These guys were the ones that figured out and helped develop the method we are all using here to allow Android devices to work properly on MetroPCS and Cricket.

Enjoy.
