MetroPCS Proxy Switcher

This "app" allows the phone to automatically switch proxy and u2nl binary on and off depending on Wi-fi state.
It is made and pre-configured to work with Android phones that have been flashed to MetroPCS.

It must be built with the system since its using android.uid.system sharedId in order to be able to write to secure settings.

Have been tested and built for HTC EVO, Droid Incredible, and Motorola Droid (1).
Made to work with CyanogenMod 6.0+



TODO:

- Needs a better icon.
- Improve startup/shutdown of u2nl binary, if possible.
- Document, organize and maybe improve configuration screen.
